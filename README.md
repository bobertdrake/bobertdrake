## What I'm Building

**🦅 FalconryLab**
  Native iOS platform for falconers to track birds, weights, training sessions, and manage apprenticeships. Full-stack Swift from client to server.

  **The problem:** Falconers were stuck with abandoned web apps and outdated tools that didn't respect the craft's precision requirements. Weight tracking, training logs, and sponsor relationships
  needed purpose-built software, not generic fitness trackers.

  **The solution:** Native iOS app with offline-first sync. Complete CRUD operations work without connectivity. Intelligent conflict resolution ensures data integrity. Type-safe Swift across the
  entire stack eliminates entire classes of runtime errors.

  **Stack:** SwiftUI · SwiftData · Vapor 4 · PostgreSQL · Redis

  Currently in active development. TestFlight beta planned for Q2 2026.
  
The falconry community needed better tools. Building it from scratch with modern Swift stack.
